		<b><u>Polyurethane Bushing Bronze Bearing Conversion Kit</u></b><br>
		<br>
		<a href="/"><img class="img" src="images/bushingpackages/bronzeconversion.jpg" alt="Bronze Conversion"/></a>
		<br><br>
		So far this is our favorite option. It is perfect for people who want better performance out of their already installed poly bushings, but don't want to go all out and run delrin everywhere. This kit will replace all the metal sleeves that come with your poly kit with higher strength sleeves and . <a href="http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matguid=6cd068e9169f4f5590198b7f8ef15b59">SAE863 bearings</a>.<br><br>
		It contains the following:<br>
		- Bronze bearings and sleeves for all bushing locations on the car<br>
		<br>
		Note: The FUCA bushings must be drilled out, at some point we may offer an exchange program but as of now you must ship your FUCA bushings to us to have them drilled out. He will then ship them back to you with the whole retrofit kit.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Price:</b> $330<br>
		<br>

		<b><u>The NASA Full Enchilada</u></b><br>

		<br>
		<b><u>Offset Lower Control Arm Bushing</u></b><br>
		<br>
		A common solution to gaining more camber in the front of a Miata is to install an offset upper bushing. While this does increase camber, it also decreases bump travel when using wider than 8" wheels. We recommend using a delrin offset bushing in the forward lower control arm position combined with a poly bushing in the aft lower control arm position.<br>
		<br>
		Until now the only way to get a bushing like this was to have it custom made. Not anymore, SADFab is offering offset forward lower control arm bushings to get all the camber you want.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Price:</b> $70<br>
		<br>
		Note: All delrin bushings require drilling out with a 7/8" drill after pressing into control arms.<br>
		<br>
		<b><u>Notes:</u></b><br>
		-All prices include shipping, and most of our packages can be adjusted to fit your needs just shoot us an email at info@sadfab.com and we will make something work.
